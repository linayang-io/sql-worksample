# Data Analysis using SQL
During my General Assembly certification course in data analytics, one of our projects was to run SQL queries in a PostgreSQL database that houses a [test flight](https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073326/https://testpilot.mozillalabs.com/testcases/a-week-life-2/aggregated-data.html) with customer surveys and usage analytics of Mozilla Firefox users. We were tasked to imagine being a product manager for Mozilla Firefox and put together a presentation recommending the area of focus for a new version of Firefox and whether the product team needs to revamp the bookmark experience based on analysis of this data. Visualizations of analysis was created in Tableau and put into a PowerPoint presentation. Project date: September 2017

# Mozilla Firefox Product Usage
Product analysis can inform and shape your product features and digital roadmap. Understanding user behavior through data can bring to surface whether improvements are necessary to keep your product competitive in the market. 

#### Hypothesis/assumptions
1. Users do not rely on bookmarks as much as they do on tabs
#### Goals and success metrics
1. Understand whether it is a sound investment to improve the Mozilla Firefox infrastructure to be able to support having a large number of tabs
#### Risks and Limitations 
1. The sample size of the Firefox users consists of 27,267 users. Of those users, 4,081 users answered the survey. 
2. The survey sample is highly skewed male and are long-time users
#### Conclusion
The initial analysis of the data allows us to see the distribution of tab and browser usage. With tabs, based on the distribution graph, it looks like the majority of users launched 10 or less tabs during the sample week. Regardless of how long users have been using Firefox, the users typically stay within this range. With the distribution of bookmarks, the range is between 9-30 bookmarks. Based on the findings, I would recommend further product analysis before Firefox commits to the development in increasing the usability of tabs and browsers. Especially a cost and time analysis of development. I also think it would behoove the Firefox team to do some follow up market research to see why certain users use other browsers to see what Firefox is lacking.
